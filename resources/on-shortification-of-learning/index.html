<p>Learning is not supposed to be fun. It doesn't have to be actively not fun either, but the primary feeling should be
that of effort. It should look a lot less like that &quot;10 minute full body&quot; workout from your local digital media
creator and a lot more like a serious session at the gym. You want the mental equivalent of sweating.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are consuming content: are you trying to be entertained or are you trying to learn? And if you are creating
content: are you trying to entertain or are you trying to teach? You'll go down a different path in each case.
Attempts to seek the stuff in between actually clamp to zero.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unless you are trying to learn something narrow and specific, close those tabs with quick blog posts. Close those tabs
of &quot;Learn XYZ in 10 minutes&quot;. Consider the opportunity cost of snacking and seek the meal - the textbooks, docs,
papers, manuals, longform. Allocate a 4 hour window. Don't just read, take notes, re-read, re-phrase, process,
manipulate, learn.</p>
