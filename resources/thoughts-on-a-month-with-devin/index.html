      <p>Good case study of real world usage of AI with concrete examples.  This specifically goes over experience with an
agent built for software dev use case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The results were sobering. Out of 20 tasks, we had 14 failures, 3 successes (including our 2 initial ones), and 3
inconclusive results. Even more telling was that we couldn’t discern any pattern to predict which tasks would work.
Tasks that seemed similar to our early successes would fail in unexpected ways.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This reflects a pattern we’ve observed repeatedly in AI tooling. Social media excitement and company valuations have
minimal relationship to real-world utility. We’ve found the most reliable signal comes from detailed stories of users
shipping products and services.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For now, we’re sticking with tools that let us drive the development process while providing AI assistance along the
way.</p>
