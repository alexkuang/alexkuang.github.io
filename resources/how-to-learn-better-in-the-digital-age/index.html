      <blockquote>
<p>I see edutainment as preparation for learning: it’s a powerful explorative tool that can provide ideas and motivation
to learn. And yet, it’s also not learning itself, in the same way as buying running shoes is not running. Within this
framework, “mindless” browsing online can be transformed into scouting for learning opportunities.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The process takes a lot of time and effort, which means it’s not something I can afford to do with every piece of
content I find online. Most of the time I trash the links I find, upon further review. Sometimes they end up in my
learning wish list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/notes/real-learning-is-effortful/">Real learning is effortful</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The core idea is trying my best to not kid myself: when my engagement with a piece of content is active and effortful
then it’s learning, when it’s passive it’s entertainment. When I create I learn. When I consume I just relax.</p>
