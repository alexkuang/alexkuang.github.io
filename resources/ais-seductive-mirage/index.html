      <blockquote>
<p>Here’s the logic:</p>
<ol>
<li>AI systems produce outputs that resemble what meaning-making humans can produce, and …</li>
<li>Lack of clarity about meaning-making leads us to incorrectly believe that meaning-making outputs are the same as
meaning-making activity, so …</li>
<li>AI systems <em>appear</em> to have affordances that are coterminous with human capabilities.  Meaning-making is the most
important of these affordances, all of which are easily perceived and used but …</li>
<li>AI systems can’t make meaning on their own (yet) — so meaning-making is a fake AI system affordance that is
nonetheless easily perceived/used.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>AI is incapable of meaningmaking, where (very tl;dr) meaningmaking = <a href="/notes/ai-cant-make-subjective-value-decisions/">subjective decisions about value</a>.</p>
<p>Any appearance of meaningmaking from AI is &quot;inherited&quot; from its training data.</p>
