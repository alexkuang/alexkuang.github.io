      <blockquote>
<p>Here's the most counterintuitive thing I've discovered: AI tools help experienced developers more than beginners. The
reality is that AI is like having a very eager junior developer on your team.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A tweet that recently caught my eye perfectly captures what I've been observing in the field: Non-engineers using AI
for coding find themselves hitting a frustrating wall. They can get 70% of the way there surprisingly quickly, but
that final 30% becomes an exercise in diminishing returns.
[...]
Teams use AI to rapidly build impressive demos. The happy path works beautifully. Investors and social networks are
wowed. But when real users start clicking around? That's when things fall apart.  I've seen this firsthand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Error &gt; messages that make no sense to normal users</li>
<li>Edge cases that crash the application</li>
<li>Confusing UI states that never got cleaned up</li>
<li>Accessibility completely overlooked</li>
<li>Performance issues on slower devices</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This feels like a similar &quot;shape&quot; of idea to <a href="/notes/ai-demo-product-chasm/">AI demo-product chasm</a>, but on usage / product built with AI rather than
product built on top of AI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite these challenges, I'm optimistic about AI's role in software development. The key is understanding what it's
really good for: Accelerating the known [...] Exploring the possible [...] Automating the routine</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May generalize beyond software dev.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By handling the routine coding tasks, they free up developers to focus on what matters most - creating software that
truly serves and delights users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really similar / same-ish real world benefit as cited in <a href="/resources/real-intelligence-unqualified-opinions/">Real Intelligence &lpar;Unqualified Opinions&rpar;</a> for AI usage</p>
