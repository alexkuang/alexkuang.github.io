<h3>Hello, world!</h3>
<h3>/notes</h3>
<p>Welcome to my corner of the internet.  Think of it as a sort of combo public-wiki-slash-brain-dump-slash-website.  I think
the cool kids call it a &quot;digital garden.&quot;</p>
<p>In the future there may be a fancy feed / getting started thing.  For now, the best place to start is probably the
latest <a href="https://github.com/alexkuang/alexkuang.github.io/commits/main/">GitHub commits</a>.</p>
<p>Usual disclaimers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything here is provided on an &quot;as is&quot; basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, (etc etc :)  Per laws
of the internet, anything may change or be removed without notice.</li>
<li>All opinions my own unless explicitly stated.  Notes may be horribly wrong and can have as little as 10 min of thought behind them.</li>
<li>Most notes can and probably will lack context, especially off the beaten path.  This is very much on purpose.  That
said, feel free to reach out. I love nerding out with interesting people.</li>
</ul>
<h3>/contact</h3>
<p>The best way to get in touch is email: hi @ this domain.</p>
<p>I'm also on the socials: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/waffledotexe.bsky.social">sky app</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/waffledotexe">bird
