      <h2>AI can&#39;t make subjective value decisions</h2>

      <p>AI is unable to make decisions around subjective value on its own, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>This meeting is important to me and this one is not</li>
<li>This image is fits our aesthetic and this one does not</li>
</ul>
<p>As it stands today, any appearance of subjective value decision is drawn directly from training data or the prompt.
Critically, we're not at a point where AI can independently reason out new concepts of subjective value (which would be a
lot closer to AGI?)</p>
<p>Related framings / thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI can't create new abstractions on its own, because abstractions inherently involve deciding what is important vs
what can be abstracted out.</li>
<li>Baseline for AI functionality is a college intern, i.e. can do mechanical work but needs lots of nudging around
business context + &quot;what's important&quot; in its work output.</li>
</ul>
