      <h2>aspiration-first vs reality-first</h2>

      <p>Over the years I've noticed people seem to have two fundamental orientations towards goals: aspiration-first and
reality-first.</p>
<p>Aspiration-first thinking starts with an external or motivational stance.  For example: &quot;I need to lose 20 lb before
summer to fit into my beach clothes / reach a certain BMI / etc&quot;  Or in business: &quot;We need $1MM ARR this year because
that's the benchmark for companies of our stage.&quot;  From there, achievement is throwing stuff against the wall till
something hits the right trajectory.</p>
<p>Reality-first thinking starts with understanding the reality of a situation or system and works from there.  For
example: &quot;Studies suggest sustainable weight loss is 300-500kcal deficit per day, so I should lose Xlb by summer.  But
also I like eating, so maybe (X - 5)lb is a better goal.&quot;  Or: &quot;Historically our revenue growth has been X per month,
but our sales process isn't as efficient as it could be, so with some tweaks we should be able to get it to (120% of X)
per month.&quot;</p>
<p>This rhymes a bit with &quot;top-down&quot; vs &quot;bottom-up,&quot; but I don't think they are the same.  If an experienced CEO says &quot;we
should get our revenue up 15% within the next 6 months,&quot; that's top-down but could be reality-first because that goal is
informed by a long career in similar companies where they have increased revenue by 15% in 6 months.  Likewise, a
bottom-up goal might be &quot;reduce server costs 20%&quot; in service of reducing burn rate... But that 20% number could be
completely aspirational with no basis in reality.</p>
<p>Both approaches have their pro's and con's.  Reality-first has the obvious advantage of being easier to reason about:
either execution is off, or an assumption about reality was wrong.  In that way, the lines of accountability are
clearer.  There's no &quot;shucks we tried, but...&quot;  However, sometimes a situation is so uncertain that you have no choice
but to be aspirational.  (Though I'd argue that &quot;setting goals&quot; is less useful then, vs taking a stance of &quot;learning
about reality.&quot;)  Lastly: the &quot;big hairy audacious&quot; goals that are popular in management literature are aspirational by
definition, so they may be necessary for certain types of work.</p>
<p>To the surprise of absolutely nobody, I favor the reality-first approach as a developer-slash-systems-person.  That
might mean my goals are not as big, hairy, and audacious as they could be but... I can live with that :)</p>
