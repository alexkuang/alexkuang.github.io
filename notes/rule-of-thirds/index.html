      <h2>rule of thirds</h2>

      <blockquote>
<p>When you're chasing a big goal, you're supposed to feel good a third of the time, okay a third of the time, and crappy
a third of the time... and if the ratio is roughly in that range, then you're doing fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This probably applies to sustainable growth / &quot;productive discomfort&quot; in general.  Corollaries: If you're consistently
feeling good, say, &gt;50% of the time, you're not pushing hard enough to grow.  If you're feeling crappy &gt;50% of the time,
you're pushing too hard to be productive.</p>
<p>It may also by why small + consistent sessions are recommended over long but infrequent ones, whether that's workouts or
knowledge work like writing.  In addition to volume + habit benefits, you get the full &quot;range&quot; of sessions.  In 3 1H
sessions you can have a good one, a tough one, and an okay one.  In contrast, you're unlikely to have a great + okay +
tough combo in 1 3H session.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://danjohnuniversity.com/">Dan John</a> in <em>Never Let Go</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a group of five workouts, I tend to have one great workout, the kind of workout that makes me think in just a few
weeks I could be an Olympic champion, or maybe Mr. Olympia.  Then, I have one workout that's so awful the mere fact I
continue to exist as a somewhat higher form of life is a miracle.  Finally, the other three workouts are the
punch-the-clock workouts: I go in, work out, and walk out.  Most people experience this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not quite thirds, but directionally tracks.</p>
