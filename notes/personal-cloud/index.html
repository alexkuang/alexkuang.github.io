      <h2>personal cloud</h2>

      <p>This is a general container page for all things with my experiment in building a personal cloud in AWS</p>
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>Companies have clouds that they control where their data live, their workloads run, and their general &quot;digital lives&quot;
take place. Why shouldn't individuals have the same? The idea of a personal cloud has been living rent-free in my head
for at least two or three years now.</p>
<p>Being that I have acquired a very <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZOywn1qArI">particular set of skills</a>
over a very medium-length career, I've been working on and off on a personal cloud of my own. There are a couple reasons
this remains my pet project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dissatisfaction with the status quo where our digital lives are fragmented and we don't have real access to our own
data.</li>
<li>Balancing life as a <a href="https://gazzini.com/writing/pp/">discount attorney</a> with some actual technology work.</li>
<li>Belief that the usefulness of recent <s>AI</s> applied statistics / LLM tech is directly correlated with the level of
personalization in the training data used.</li>
<li>A distrust of random startups to responsibly keep and use said personal data.</li>
<li>OK, fine, a little bit of hubris and wondering &quot;surely this is not that hard and good software can still be made by
one person.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3>appendix a: existing work</h3>
<p>Some fellow travelers on the path, who have had similar thoughts and inclinations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/">Stephen Wolfram's Personal Infrastructure</a>
is probably the closest thing I've seen to a fully fledged &quot;personal cloud&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://hyfen.net/memex/">Andrew Lewis' Memex</a>, a very cool timeline-oriented frontend to personal data</li>
<li><a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/hpi.html">karlicoss' Human Programming Interface</a> for inspiration in approach to data extraction and backup</li>
</ul>
<h3>appendix b: trusting amazon</h3>
<p>&quot;If distrust of third parties is a motive, aren't you still trusting Amazon with your data?&quot; Yes, I am. Insofar as I'm
not quite paranoid enough to fly my own servers on drones above international waters, I have to trust some sort of
vendor at some level... and honestly? AWS, for all their faults, is easily top 3 (if not #1) of vendors I've worked
with. They have a long history of excellent operational chops and doing right by their customers with regards to
product, price, and whatever else. Could do a lot worse.</p>
