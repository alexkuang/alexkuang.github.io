      <h2>shopify for saas</h2>

      <p>What could a &quot;Shopify for SaaS companies&quot; look like? Shopify helps with undifferentiated heavy lifting in ecomm: user
registration + login, order status emails, cart management, etc. With Shopify, merchants are free to focus on the core
unique competitive parts of their business: making + selling their product.</p>
<p>It feels like there's the same sort of undifferentiated heavy lifting in building a SaaS business, so what's the
equivalent? This turned into a long one so hold onto your butts, y'all.</p>
<h3>Users + everything around them</h3>
<p>A &quot;Shopify for SaaS&quot; has to be built around customer data. Every SaaS company has some notion of a customer account,
from an individual user up to an organization of multiple teams of users. Managing user records requires user login /
registration as a minimum. Teams of users requires support for roles and permissions, e.g. &quot;only a team manager can add
a user to a team.&quot; This is well-trodden territory, with both <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">enterprise players</a> and
startups that are mature enough to have <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/okta-acquisition-announcement/">exited</a>.</p>
<p>What's missing is connecting these records to everything else:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing billing against product functionality, e.g. &quot;only enterprise tier customers can access X feature,&quot; &quot;customer
A only has N credits left.&quot;</li>
<li>Attribution of a customer to a marketing campaign, traffic source, or CRM lead. Sending information back into the
original CRM for upsells and other post-sale activity.</li>
<li>Syncing with customer service software so that requests can be triaged for existing customers vs new users, tier of
customer, etc.</li>
<li>Other functionality that's somewhat tied to the product lifecycle but generic to the business, e.g. user referral
program management.</li>
<li>These are all items that 1) most SaaS companies need to grow and operate, 2) suck up a lot of resources usually in the
form of developer time + operations debt, but 3) are not part of the business' core offering.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I like a lot</h3>
<ul>
<li>Solving this problem reduces the amount of toil required for SaaS businesses and is a net good for the world.</li>
<li>Developers are typically the costliest resource in a software company, so it's very much in businesses' interest to
only allocate dev time to work that will make or break the business.</li>
<li>As a kicker, this type of work is tedious scut work for 99% of developers – I say this with all the love of having
built at least half a dozen such systems. They'd rather be working on a cool customer-facing feature, and so probably
will drag their feet at the prospect of Yet Another Marketo Sync.</li>
<li>Big switching cost moat. Ripping out a user reg system is already nerve-wracking on the best of days. Replacing that +
everything else? Forget it.</li>
<li>Unlike ~most SaaS ideas these days, product + architecture can be an enduring competitive advantage. Tacit knowledge
of vendors' APIs + idiosyncrasies, followed by effectively managing and abstracting that away from the customer, adds
up to some serious <a href="https://7powers.com/">process power</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I like less</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tight timing window for sales and likely a looong ramp to revenue growth. Getting an existing company to adopt a new
solution is hard because of switching costs. Prospects need to be found and closed just as they're starting a product
buildout, and most people do not start new companies (or even products) that often.</li>
<li>The large surface area can make it hard to gain momentum without a large up-front investment. e.g. it's hard to get
operational leverage on your Zendesk integration if your first five customers want to use Zendesk, Intercom,
Freshdesk, and Helpscout.</li>
<li>Market education will contribute to the cold start problem. Founders today do not commonly search for a solution in
this shape, e.g. there are no google keywords to go bid up as far as I know. Market awareness needs to be built from
scratch, which is a long and arduous grind.</li>
<li>I believe that &quot;a great strength is also a weakness&quot; (and vice versa). So unsurprisingly, a lot of the con's here are
just the other side of the coin for the pro's. All that said, what are some angles of attack?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Possible approaches</h3>
<h4>productized consulting</h4>
<ul>
<li>Customer comes to you, says &quot;We're building a b2b saas that does [...] It's got a few tiers of flat monthly fees and
customers will likely need teams, [...]&quot; With that info, determine the most likely combination that they will need.</li>
<li>Deliver a &quot;product-in-a-box.&quot; This can be a code repo in a popular tech stack, e.g. Rails, Next.js, Laravel, etc.
Include boilerplate for integrating with all the bits needed in their stack: Zendesk, Hubspot, Stripe, and so on. Just
put in the API keys and go.</li>
<li>Going further: a done-for-you tier. Sign up for the relevant services with best practice setups. Instead of a code
repo, there is now a deployed PoC with everything fully plugged in and ready for dev. Hand over a 1Pass vault with all
the credentials. Batteries (and API keys) included.</li>
<li>Hang around startup accelerators, incubators, etc, and offer these services to start. This is a good way to gauge
demand + fit. If one is determined to not take funding, revenue from this consulting could be used to bootstrap a
sustainable product.</li>
</ul>
<h4>integrations as a service</h4>
<ul>
<li>Deliver a middleware SaaS application (let's call it SaaSify) that sits as an intermediary between the main product
and all the other service providers.</li>
<li>Developers get a single, sane, vendor-agnostic API for users, application-level events, CRM sync, etc. SaaSify helps
normalize all data passing through the systems, e.g. phone and country code formats, email case sensitivity, timestamp
time zones.</li>
<li>SaaSify also handles common API infra operations. Where possible, it automatically handles concerns like idempotency,
retries, rate limiting, etc. It nudges towards best practice for all implementations.</li>
<li>Folks in operations, marketing, etc get a polished admin panel that represents a single source of truth for the user.
Information is easily shared between teams because it's living in one place and reflecting the data across different
systems.</li>
<li>Staff can perform common tasks like updating customer billing info in SaaSify, or jump out to the specific vendor for
more involved work. Information is synced back and forth automatically.</li>
</ul>
<h4>oracle, but make it sexy</h4>
<ul>
<li>I feel like modern tech startup workers have an instinctual ick for the likes of Oracle and SAP, but I'm going to drop
this here anyway. What if it's time for a
<a href="https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling">re-bundling</a> of SaaS company
infrastructure?</li>
<li>The current abundance of separate products per function has offered endless flexibility, but everyone I've talked to
has gotten tired of managing it all – not to mention the $$. Now that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_interest-rate_policy">ZIRP</a> is over by most accounts, folks are starting to pay
more attention to their burn rate – and by extension, the total cost of their piecemeal application
stack.</li>
<li>Is there finally room in the market for a fully integrated solution again? Would people go for a product that does
their CRM, user reg, billing, email flows, etc? One that offers 80% of the functionality of separate apps for, say,
50% of the price and 30% of the complexity? &quot;Oracle, but not shit and made for modern tech companies&quot;?</li>
<li>'cause let's be real here, even assuming we know what &quot;best in class&quot; means, is e.g. helpdesk software choice really
moving the needle for the business? Is a handful of incremental features in Zendesk vs Intercom really going to make
or break the company? Or will it make a bigger impact to spend less time futzing with 23 SaaSes and more time thinking
about the business' customer and core product?</li>
<li>Those aren't rhetorical questions, by the way. I honestly have no idea if such a thing would fly right now. Just
throwing the idea out there.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>I first thought about &quot;Shopify for SaaS&quot; circa ~2020-21 while considering startup ideas. Flash forward
to 2024 and I think this is still as real a problem as before. Is this the right shape of solution and can a real
business can be built around it? Well, that's the question isn't it.</p>
