      <h2>zero-based</h2>

      <p>I first saw &quot;zero-based budgeting&quot; in some leisurely weekend reading on private equity firms (I know, party animal
comin' through). The idea is to start each annual budgeting process &quot;from zero&quot; and justify all expenses from scratch
instead of anchoring on existing spend. &quot;How much should we spend on X,&quot; instead of &quot;cut 5% off X this year&quot;</p>
<p>This is a useful framework for other contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every day you stay at a job is a decision to take that job, knowing what you know that day.</li>
<li>Every day you hold an investment position is a decision to buy on that day's price and fundamentals.</li>
<li>Every day you spend in a relationship, friendship, partnership is a decision to... you get the idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, it's not perfect. Real life has pesky things like transaction costs, but that's entirely the point. Starting
from zero is an offset against complacency and over-indexing on sunk costs.</p>
