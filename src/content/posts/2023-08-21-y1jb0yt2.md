[How to Learn Better in the Digital Age](https://giansegato.com/essays/edutainment-is-not-learning)

> I see edutainment as preparation for learning: it’s a powerful explorative tool that can provide ideas and motivation
> to learn. And yet, it’s also not learning itself, in the same way as buying running shoes is not running. Within this
> framework, “mindless” browsing online can be transformed into scouting for learning opportunities.

> The process takes a lot of time and effort, which means it’s not something I can afford to do with every piece of
> content I find online. Most of the time I trash the links I find, upon further review. Sometimes they end up in my
> learning wish list.

> The core idea is trying my best to not kid myself: when my engagement with a piece of content is active and effortful
> then it’s learning, when it’s passive it’s entertainment. When I create I learn. When I consume I just relax.
