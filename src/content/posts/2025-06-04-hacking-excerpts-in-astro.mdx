**Update Dec 11 2025:** I've scrapped the excerpt pre-rendering approach entirely after switching to MDX.  The MDX
rendering pipeline is even harder to hook into than markdown, with no (straightforward) programmatic API exposed. The
blog now renders full post content on the feed with `line-clamp` for visual truncation.  This approach ensures
consistent rendering behavior at the cost of shipping more HTML per page. Pagination helps keep page sizes reasonable.

I wanted to do excerpts to give the main blog page more of a "feed" than a "post list" feeling.  Surprisingly there
wasn't a straightforward / built-in way to do it in astro.  The markdown => HTML conversion seems to happen as part of
loading a post collection, and any downstream methods like `render()` just reuses that HTML.

When I looked around there were two bits of prior art:

- The [top google result](https://www.paulie.dev/posts/2023/09/how-to-create-excerpts-with-astro) renders the post
  `body` with an external library and then truncates the result.  I didn't love this because it seemed error-prone,
  e.g. it's easy to truncate through the middle of a codeblock.  Using `markdown-it` also means that none of the astro
  setup, e.g. syntax highlighting, is reused.
- I also tried out a [library](https://github.com/igorskyflyer/npm-astro-post-excerpt) from the astro integrations list,
  but its output heavily favored simplicity and dropped a lot of things I cared about, e.g. blockquotes.

Eventually I read through the astro code + the library and settled on the following approach:

```js
import { createMarkdownProcessor } from "@astrojs/markdown-remark";
import { fromMarkdown } from "mdast-util-from-markdown";
import { toMarkdown } from "mdast-util-to-markdown";

const renderer = await createMarkdownProcessor();

async function getExcerpt(post: CollectionEntry<"posts">, maxChars: number) {
  const rawBody = post.body || "";

  // convert to an AST to work with structured data
  const parsed = fromMarkdown(rawBody);
  // generate AST for excerpt and convert it back to plain text
  const truncated = toMarkdown(truncateMarkdown(parsed, maxChars));

  // use astro's remark setup to render to html
  return (await renderer.render(truncated)).code;
}

function truncateMarkdown(root: node, maxChars: number) {
  // do stuff to the tree here
}
```

And then in usage:

```astro
<Fragment set:html={getExcerpt(post, post.excerptLimit)} />
```

This isn't *perfect* since astro passes in a bunch of config to both `createMarkdownProcessor` and the `render`
call to make fancy things like relative URLs work.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find a straightforward way to replicate
all that, so for now this setup will have to do.  I also have no idea if this works with mdx or how hard that would be.
