Just finished reading [Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow](https://www.amazon.com/Tomorrow-novel-Gabrielle-Zevin/dp/0593321200/)
this past week and it's the best fiction I've read in recent memory.  Certainly the best realistic-ish fiction I've read
in years.  Whether it's the close demographic match (Asian immigrant, grew up with the internet, spent a lot of
childhood in virtual game worlds...), the fresh variation of style and framing devices, or quippy lines like "To return
to the city of one's birth always felt like retreat," this one just *hit*.

It's not perfect book by any means.  But chances are if you're on this blog and still reading for whatever reason,
you'll probably like it too.  In the meantime guess I'm gonna read AJ Fikry just in time for the movie.
