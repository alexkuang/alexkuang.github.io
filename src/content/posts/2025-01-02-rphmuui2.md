[on shortification of "learning"](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1756380066580455557/)

> Learning is not supposed to be fun. It doesn't have to be actively not fun either, but the primary feeling should be
> that of effort. It should look a lot less like that "10 minute full body" workout from your local digital media
> creator and a lot more like a serious session at the gym. You want the mental equivalent of sweating.

> If you are consuming content: are you trying to be entertained or are you trying to learn? And if you are creating
> content: are you trying to entertain or are you trying to teach? You'll go down a different path in each case.
> Attempts to seek the stuff in between actually clamp to zero.

> Unless you are trying to learn something narrow and specific, close those tabs with quick blog posts. Close those tabs
> of "Learn XYZ in 10 minutes". Consider the opportunity cost of snacking and seek the meal - the textbooks, docs,
> papers, manuals, longform. Allocate a 4 hour window. Don't just read, take notes, re-read, re-phrase, process,
> manipulate, learn.
