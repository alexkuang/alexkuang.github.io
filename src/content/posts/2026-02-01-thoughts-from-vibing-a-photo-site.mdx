So I vibe-coded a [photo site](https://photos.makeshift.computer/), in the truest sense of the term: aside from a few
naming edits and obviously the album + copy itself, I wrote exactly 0% of the code by hand.  Some of the code, I barely
even read.  In all, the LLM wrote:

- The website itself, which is a static website driven by [astro](https://astro.build/).  The output is entirely
  vanilla: plain HTML, css, js.
- [CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) code for the hosting infrastructure, S3 + Cloudfront.
- Utility scripts, mostly python, for workflow: collating image names, working exif data, bulk upload, etc.

### How did it go?

This is the exact type of "nice to have" project that would have been too much of a pain to do without LLMs.  Most of
the vibing happened in the in-between times: waiting for claude to crunch on harder problems, in between cooking dinner,
etc.  As a testament to the progress of LLMs, I vaguely recall attempting something like this back in 2024 and the
results were not nearly good enough to publish.  (Right, yes, I could have gotten it there, but again, too much of a
pain.)  This time, prompting more or less Just Worked on both the astro site as well as the more finicky CDK code.

Does this mean the AI is coming for our jobs?  At time of writing in early 2026, I'd still lean no.  Despite prompting
"just working," it was heavily helped by my ~two decades of experience writing software.  I had to steer it a lot: from
little things like "include a `requirements.txt` for python and update `.tool-versions`" to big things like "dropping to
L1 CDK constructs seems really dumb here, are you *sure* this is the issue."

... Then there's the obvious fact that this is a photo site.  I would absolutely not take this approach to production
code, and barring some extinction-level jumps in model intelligence, I'm not sure I'll ever get there.  So can we count
this photo site as "productivity gainz"?  Technically, sure, I guess?  But when pundits reference the 10x+ productivity
jump, they usually mean serious software with economic value.

### The Great Deployment Filter

The biggest friction point, and where technical experience really comes into play, is in the deployment.  Vibing a
S3+Cloudfront setup only works because I'm masochistic enough to already have a personal AWS account managed via CDK,
and know CDK well enough to see that Claude is not doing something completely deranged.  I recognize that running your
own AWS is...  slightly unusual, even for developer-y types.  In contrast, a non-technical person would have had to
figure out, from scratch, hosting for photo assets and deployment for the site itself.  We quickly go from "speak
english to claude" to "here's a [list of clouds](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/),
[glhfdd](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=glhfdd)" And this is just for a static html website -- no
external APIs, OAuth integrations, etc making life even harder.

Insofar as we want LLMs to lower the barrier to entry for shipping software, deployment and runtime is still one of the
biggest constraints right now.
