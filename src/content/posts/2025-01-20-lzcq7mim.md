[Real Intelligence](https://www.permanentequity.com/unqualified-opinions-roll/real-intelligence):

Case of AI usage outside of the "usual" techno-sphere.

> artificial intelligence (AI) was now handling some 40% of customer service inquiries and that that number had
> increased from just 10% in a few short months.
>
> Someone else, listening in on the conversation, asked if his in-house customer service team, seeing this trend, feared
> for their jobs? But Kevin said no, that they loved the AI because it enabled them to spend more time solving the
> customer service inquiries that required depth of touch

> there are small problems that are best handled quickly and complicated problems that are best handled carefully.
> Further, while handling the small problems quickly can show up almost immediately on the income statement in the form
> of revenue retention, itâ€™s handling the complicated problems carefully that can create tremendous lifetime value and
> turn your customers into zealots who will proselytize for your brand.

> So an interesting thing to think about is which problems in your business might require *real* intelligence.
> Because in the end, thatâ€™s my hope for AI. That it can take away from us the things we spend time on that make us less
> real and less human, so, like Rylee + Cruâ€™s customer service team, we can spend more time on the things that make us
> just that.
