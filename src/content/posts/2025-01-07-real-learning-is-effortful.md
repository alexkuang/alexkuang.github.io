Real learning (the kind that sticks) requires active effort and engagement with the material: building a toy project,
writing a critical essay, etc.  Passive consumption (especially of short form media) should be treated as entertainment
more than learning.

The rule of thirds applies here.  The valence when e.g. reading the average Twitter post tends to be pretty flat.  There
are no "tough" sessions of scrolling the feed (or, conversely really "great" sessions), so how much growth is really
taking place?
