title: build mech suits, not robots
---

General philosophy of software / automation design.  Rather than build a "robot" that entirely replaces a human,
build a "mech suit" that lets the human do human things.  e.g. mech suit allows human to move fast + lift heavy
things, human decides what heavy things most need lifting where.

Especially relevant in the age of LLMs because [[AI can't make subjective value decisions]].
