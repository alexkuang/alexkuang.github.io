title: AI demo-product chasm
---

Despite the social media hype, there is a huge gap between a demo (i.e., "good enough for a screenshot") and a product
(i.e. sustainably + generally better than directly feeding prompts to OpenAI/Claude).  A naive wrapper around a small
set of prompts might be good enough for the first handful of users, but tends to quickly degenerate as more users bring
their respective edge cases.

This gets worse with time, as it gets harder to intuit e.g. which prompt tweaks + model changes are making the app
better or worse for which users.

With even modest scale, development of apps based on foundation models starts looking a lot less like "FE + BE" or "full
stack web app" and more like data science + infra.
