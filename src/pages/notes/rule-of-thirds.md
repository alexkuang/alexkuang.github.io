title: rule of thirds

> When you're chasing a big goal, you're supposed to feel good a third of the time, okay a third of the time, and crappy
> a third of the time... and if the ratio is roughly in that range, then you're doing fine.

This probably applies to sustainable growth / "productive discomfort" in general.  Corollaries: If you're consistently
feeling good, say, >50% of the time, you're not pushing hard enough to grow.  If you're feeling crappy >50% of the time,
you're pushing too hard to be productive.

It may also by why small + consistent sessions are recommended over long but infrequent ones, whether that's workouts or
knowledge work like writing.  In addition to volume + habit benefits, you get the full "range" of sessions.  In 3 1H
sessions you can have a good one, a tough one, and an okay one.  In contrast, you're unlikely to have a great + okay +
tough combo in 1 3H session.

Not quite thirds, but directionally tracks.
