title: AI can't make subjective value decisions
---

AI is unable to make decisions around subjective value on its own, e.g.:
- This meeting is important to me and this one is not
- This image is fits our aesthetic and this one does not

As it stands today, any appearance of subjective value decision is drawn directly from training data or the prompt.
Critically, we're not at a point where AI can independently reason out new concepts of subjective value (which would be a
lot closer to AGI?)

Related framings / thoughts:
- AI can't create new abstractions on its own, because abstractions inherently involve deciding what is important vs
  what can be abstracted out.
- Baseline for AI functionality is a college intern, i.e. can do mechanical work but needs lots of nudging around
  business context + "what's important" in its work output.
