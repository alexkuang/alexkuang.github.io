title: personal cloud
---

This is a general container page for all things with my experiment in building a personal cloud in AWS

### Why

Companies have clouds that they control where their data live, their workloads run, and their general "digital lives"
take place. Why shouldn't individuals have the same? The idea of a personal cloud has been living rent-free in my head
for at least two or three years now.

Being that I have acquired a very [particular set of skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZOywn1qArI)
over a very medium-length career, I've been working on and off on a personal cloud of my own. There are a couple reasons
this remains my pet project:

- Dissatisfaction with the status quo where our digital lives are fragmented and we don't have real access to our own
  data.
- Balancing life as a [discount attorney](https://gazzini.com/writing/pp/) with some actual technology work.
- Belief that the usefulness of recent ~~AI~~ applied statistics / LLM tech is directly correlated with the level of
  personalization in the training data used.
- A distrust of random startups to responsibly keep and use said personal data.
- OK, fine, a little bit of hubris and wondering "surely this is not that hard and good software can still be made by
  one person."

### appendix a: existing work

Some fellow travelers on the path, who have had similar thoughts and inclinations:

- [Stephen Wolfram's Personal Infrastructure](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/)
  is probably the closest thing I've seen to a fully fledged "personal cloud"
- [Andrew Lewis' Memex](https://hyfen.net/memex/), a very cool timeline-oriented frontend to personal data
- [karlicoss' Human Programming Interface](https://beepb00p.xyz/hpi.html) for inspiration in approach to data extraction and backup

### appendix b: trusting amazon

"If distrust of third parties is a motive, aren't you still trusting Amazon with your data?" Yes, I am. Insofar as I'm
not quite paranoid enough to fly my own servers on drones above international waters, I have to trust some sort of
vendor at some level... and honestly? AWS, for all their faults, is easily top 3 (if not #1) of vendors I've worked
with. They have a long history of excellent operational chops and doing right by their customers with regards to
product, price, and whatever else. Could do a lot worse.
