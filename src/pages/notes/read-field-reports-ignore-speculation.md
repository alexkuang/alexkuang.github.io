title: read field reports, ignore speculation
---

The easiest way to dodge the [[The Creative Worldâ€™s Bullshit Industrial Complex|bullshit]] in a hot field is to pay
attention to case studies and field reports rather than breathless hype and over-generalized speculation.

Field reports are first or second hand accounts of concrete use cases and things actually happened.  e.g. "here's what I
ran into when I built X," "our team tried Y and here's how it went," etc.

Speculation may include a grain of reality (or not!) but is usually written by someone on the outside and followed up
with baseless conjecture.  e.g. "X built Y in 3 days and this is why AI is coming for all our jobs," "the new oculus is
so good soon we will all be living in the metaverse," etc.
