title: real learning is effortful
---

Real learning (the kind that sticks) requires active effort and engagement with the material: building a toy project,
writing a critical essay, etc.  Passive consumption (especially of short form media) should be treated as entertainment
more than learning.

[[rule of thirds|Rule of thirds]] applies here.  The valence when e.g. reading the average Twitter post tends to be
pretty flat.  There are no "tough" sessions of scrolling the feed (or, conversely really "great" sessions), so how much
growth is really taking place?
