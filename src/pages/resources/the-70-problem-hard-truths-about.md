> Here's the most counterintuitive thing I've discovered: AI tools help experienced developers more than beginners. The
> reality is that AI is like having a very eager junior developer on your team.

> A tweet that recently caught my eye perfectly captures what I've been observing in the field: Non-engineers using AI
> for coding find themselves hitting a frustrating wall. They can get 70% of the way there surprisingly quickly, but
> that final 30% becomes an exercise in diminishing returns.
> [...]
> Teams use AI to rapidly build impressive demos. The happy path works beautifully. Investors and social networks are
> wowed. But when real users start clicking around? That's when things fall apart.  I've seen this firsthand:
> - Error > messages that make no sense to normal users
> - Edge cases that crash the application
> - Confusing UI states that never got cleaned up
> - Accessibility completely overlooked
> - Performance issues on slower devices

This feels like a similar "shape" of idea to [[AI demo-product chasm]], but on usage / product built with AI rather than
product built on top of AI.

> Despite these challenges, I'm optimistic about AI's role in software development. The key is understanding what it's
> really good for: Accelerating the known [...] Exploring the possible [...] Automating the routine

May generalize beyond software dev.

> By handling the routine coding tasks, they free up developers to focus on what matters most - creating software that
> truly serves and delights users.

Really similar / same-ish real world benefit as cited in [[Real Intelligence (Unqualified Opinions)]] for AI usage
