The best term I've found for what has happened to wide swaths of the internet as everyone tries to "build an audience,"
"be a thought leader," etc...

> The bullshit industrial complex is a pyramid of groups that goes something like this:
>
> **Group 1**: People actually shipping ideas, launching businesses, doing creative work, taking risks and sharing first-hand learnings.
>
> **Group 2**: People writing about group 1 in clear, concise, accessible language.
>
> [And here rests the line of bullshit demarcation…]
>
> **Group 3**: People aggregating the learnings of group 2, passing it off as first-hand wisdom.
>
> **Group 4**: People aggregating the learnings of group 3, believing they are as worthy of praise as the people in group 1.
>
> **Groups 5+**: And downward.
