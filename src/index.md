### Hello, world!

### /notes

Welcome to my corner of the internet.  Think of it as a sort of combo public-wiki-slash-brain-dump-slash-website.  I think
the cool kids call it a "digital garden."

In the future there may be a fancy feed / getting started thing.  For now, the best place to start is probably the
latest GitHub commits.

Usual disclaimers:
- Everything here is provided on an "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, (etc etc :)  Per laws
  of the internet, anything may change or be removed without notice.
- All opinions my own unless explicitly stated.  Notes may be horribly wrong and can have as little as 10 min of thought behind them.
- Most notes can and probably will lack context, especially off the beaten path.  This is very much on purpose.  That
  said, feel free to reach out. I love nerding out with interesting people.
