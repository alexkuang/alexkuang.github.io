            <h2>tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow</h2>

<p>Just finished reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tomorrow-novel-Gabrielle-Zevin/dp/0593321200/">Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and
Tomorrow</a> this past week and it's the best
fiction I've read in recent memory.  Certainly the best realistic-ish fiction I've read in years.  Whether it's the
close demographic match (Asian immigrant, grew up with the internet, spent a lot of childhood in virtual game
worlds...), the fresh variation of style and framing devices, or quippy lines like &quot;To return to the city of one's birth
always felt like retreat,&quot; this one just <em>hit</em>.</p>
<p>It's not perfect book by any means.  But chances are if you're on this blog and still reading for whatever reason,
you'll probably like it too.  In the meantime guess I'm gonna read AJ Fikry just in time for the movie.</p>
